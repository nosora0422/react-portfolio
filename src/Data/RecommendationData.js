        comment: "I thoroughly enjoyed working with Sora to build one of my clients' business website. She played a crucial role as a main web developer by constantly communicating with the clients to meet (and sometimes exceed) their expectations. Sora loves learning new skills and made me feel comfortable talking critically about her work. I felt like she actually loved what she was doing and really cared about her clients. I highly recommend Sora for anyone who is considering to hire or work with her.",
